# dio-datasets
Basic introduction to dataset analysis using fiftyone for the CCI Diploma. 

This session introduces you to a set of qualitative and quantitive methods we can use to analyse machine learning datasets. We'll be using the open source application [fiftyone](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone) via a Python Notebook to explore foundational datasets such as Imagenet, COCO and more.

## Set-up

We'll be using the `dip-cc` conda environment that we set up during your Python intensive. If you are facing issues with your environment, please review the set-up instructions [here](https://github.com/IrtizaNasar/Python-Bootcamp-2025/blob/main/README.md). 

### Step 1: 

1. In VS Code, create a new file `fiftyone` with the .ipynb extension.
2. Once you have you a new notebook open, check your kernel. It should read "dipcc"
